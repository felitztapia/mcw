# Modern cloud apps hands-on lab unguided 

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on lab, you will be challenged to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Azure App Services, Microsoft Azure Functions, Azure SQL Database, Azure Logic Apps, and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, workflows, and monitoring, using various components of Microsoft Azure. 

Please note that as opposed to the Whiteboard Design Session, the lab is not focused on maintaining PCI compliance and using more advanced security features such as App Service Environment, Network Security Groups, and Application Gateway. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

By the end of this hands-on lab, you will have learned how to use several key services within Azure to improve overall functionality of the original solution, and to increase the security and scalability of the new and improved design.

## Overview

The Modern cloud apps Hackathon is a hands-on exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure App Services and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, security, and scale using various components of Microsoft Azure. The Hackathon can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the Hackathon to model a real-world experience much closer and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure subscription

2.  Local machine or a virtual machine configured with:

    a.  Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition

## Solution architecture

    ![In the Add policy blade, Identity providers with the message \"1 Selected\" is selected. In the Select identity providers blade, Local Account SignIn is selected.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image24.png "Add policy and Select identity providers blades")

5.  Click **Application claims**. Here you choose claims that you want returned in the tokens sent back to your application after a successful sign-in experience. For example, select \"Display Name,\" \"Identity Provider,\" \"Postal Code,\" and \"User\'s Object ID." Click **OK**.

    ![In the Add policy blade, Application claims (4 Selected) is selected. In the Select application claims blade, the following five application claims are selected: Display Name, Identity Provider, Postal Code, and User\'s Object ID.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image25.png "Add policy and Select application claims blades")

6.  Click **Create**. Observe the policy just created appears as \"**B2C\_1\_SiIn**\" (the **B2C\_1\_** fragment is automatically added) in the **Sign-in policies** blade.

7.  Open the policy by clicking \"**B2C\_1\_SiIn**."

8.  Select \"Contoso B2C app\" in the **Applications** drop-down.

9.  Click **Run now**. A new browser tab opens, and you can run through the consumer experience of signing into your application.

### Task 5: Create a profile editing policy

To enable profile editing on your application, you will need to create a profile editing policy. This policy describes the experiences that consumers will go through during profile editing and the contents of tokens that the application will receive on successful completion.

1.  Click **Profile editing policies**.

    ![In the Policies section, Profile editing policies is selected.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image26.png "Policies section")

2.  Click **+Add** at the top of the blade.

3.  The Name determines the profile editing policy name used by your application. For example, enter \"SiPe."

4.  Click Identity providers, and select \"**Local Account SignIn**." Optionally, you can also select social identity providers, if already configured. Click **OK**.

    ![In the Add policy blade, Identity providers (1 Selected) is selected. In the Select identity providers blade, Local Account SignIn is selected.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image27.png "Add policy and Select identity providers blades")

5.  Click **Profile attributes**. Here, you choose attributes the consumer can view and edit. For example, select \"Country/Region,\" \"Display Name,\" "Job Title,\" \"Postal Code,\" "State/Province,\" and "Street Address." Click **OK**.

    ![In the Add policy blade,Profile attributes (6 Selected) is selected. In the Profile attributes blade, the following six profile attributes are selected: Country / Region, Display Name, Job Title, Postal Code, State / Province, and Street Address.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image28.png "Add policy and Select identity providers blades")

6.  Click **Application claims**. Here, you choose claims you want returned in the tokens sent back to your application after a successful profile editing experience. For example, select \"Display Name\" and \"Postal Code."

7.  Click **Create**. Observe the policy just created appears as \"**B2C\_1\_SiPe**\" (the **B2C\_1\_** fragment is automatically added) in the **Profile editing policies** blade.

8.  Open the policy by clicking \"**B2C\_1\_SiPe**."

9.  Select \"Contoso B2C app\" in the **Applications** drop-down.

10. Click **Run now**. A new browser tab opens, and you can run through the profile editing consumer experience in your application.

### Task 6: Modify the Contoso.App.SportsLeague.Web

1.  Within Visual Studio, click on **View -\> Other Windows -\> Package Manager Console**. Execute the following commands to install these the required NuGet Packages.
    ```

    -   ida:UserProfilePolicyId -- B2C\_1\_SiPe

    -   ida:AadInstance - https://login.microsoftonline.com/{0}/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration?p={1}

    ![In the App settings section, the previously mentioned settings are circled.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image29.png "App settings")

4.  Click **Save** when you are complete.

5.  Within Visual Studio, **right** click on the **Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.Web** project, and click **Add -\> New Item.**

    ![In Solution Explorer, the Web folder is expanded, and Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.Web is selected. From its right-click menu, Add is selected, and from its menu, New item is selected.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image30.png "Solution Explorer")

6.  In the Search Installed Templates search box search for OWIN. Click the OWIN Startup class, change the name to **Startup.cs,** and then click **Add**.

7.  In the new class, insert the word partial in between public and class to make this a partial class.

    ![In the New class section, the word \"partial\" is circled in the line, \"public partial class Startup\".](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image31.png "New class section")

8.  Add the following code between the brackets of the Configuration method.

    ```csharp
    ConfigureAuth(app);

    // Startup.cs
    public partial class Startup
    {
        public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
        {
            ConfigureAuth(app);
        }
    }
    ```
    
Note: The OWIN middleware will invoke the Configuration(\...) method when your app starts.

9.  Right click on the **App\_Start** folder, and click **Add -\> Class**.![In Solution Explorer, on the App Start folder\'s right-click menu, Add is selected, and from its menu, Class is selected. ](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image32.png "Solution Explorer")

10. Select **Visual C\# and Class,** and name the new file **Startup.Auth.cs**.![In the Installed field, Visual C\# is selected. In the Sort by field, Class is selected.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image33.png "Installed and Sort by fields")

11. Replace the entire contents of Startup.Auth.cs with the following code:

    ```csharp
   // App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs
    using System;
    using Owin;
    using Microsoft.Owin.Security;
    using Microsoft.Owin.Security.Cookies;
    using Microsoft.Owin.Security.OpenIdConnect;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Microsoft.Owin.Security.Notifications;
    using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols;

    using System.Configuration;
    using System.IdentityModel.Tokens;
    using System.Web.Helpers;
    using System.IdentityModel.Claims;

    namespace Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.Web
    {
        public partial class Startup
        {
            // App config settings
            private static string clientId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:ClientId"];
            private static string aadInstance = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:AadInstance"];
            private static string tenant = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:Tenant"];
            private static string redirectUri = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:RedirectUri"];

            // B2C policy identifiers
            public static string SignUpPolicyId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:SignUpPolicyId"];
            public static string SignInPolicyId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:SignInPolicyId"];
            public static string ProfilePolicyId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:UserProfilePolicyId"];

            public void ConfigureAuth(IAppBuilder app)
            {
                app.SetDefaultSignInAsAuthenticationType(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);

                app.UseCookieAuthentication(new CookieAuthenticationOptions());

                // Configure OpenID Connect middleware for each policy
                app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication(CreateOptionsFromPolicy(SignUpPolicyId));
                app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication(CreateOptionsFromPolicy(ProfilePolicyId));
                app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication(CreateOptionsFromPolicy(SignInPolicyId));
                AntiForgeryConfig.UniqueClaimTypeIdentifier = ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier;
            }

            // Used for avoiding yellow-screen-of-death
            private Task AuthenticationFailed(AuthenticationFailedNotification<OpenIdConnectMessage, OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions> notification)
            {
                notification.HandleResponse();
                if (notification.Exception.Message == "access_denied")
                {
                    notification.Response.Redirect("/");
                }
                else
                {
                    notification.Response.Redirect("/Home/Error?message=" + notification.Exception.Message);
                }

                return Task.FromResult(0);
            }

            private OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions CreateOptionsFromPolicy(string policy)
            {
                return new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions
                {
                    // For each policy, give OWIN the policy-specific metadata address, and
                    // set the authentication type to the id of the policy
                    MetadataAddress = String.Format(aadInstance, tenant, policy),
                    AuthenticationType = policy,

                    // These are standard OpenID Connect parameters, with values pulled from web.config
                    ClientId = clientId,
                    RedirectUri = redirectUri,
                    PostLogoutRedirectUri = redirectUri,
                    Notifications = new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationNotifications
                    {
                        AuthenticationFailed = AuthenticationFailed,
                    },
                    Scope = "openid",
                    ResponseType = "id_token",

                    // This piece is optional - it is used for displaying the user's name in the navigation bar.
                    TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
                    {
                        NameClaimType = "name",
                    },
                };
            }
        }
    }
    ```

> Note: The parameters you provide in OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions serve as coordinates for your app to communicate with Azure AD. You also need to set up cookie authentication. The OpenID Connect middleware uses cookies to maintain user sessions, among other things.

### Task 7: Send authentication requests to Azure AD

Your app is now properly configured to communicate with Azure AD B2C by using the OpenID Connect authentication protocol. OWIN has taken care of all of the details of crafting authentication messages, validating tokens from Azure AD, and maintaining user session. All that remains is to initiate each user\'s flow.

1.  Right click on the **Controllers** folder, and click **Add** -\> **Controller**. ![In Solution Explorer, in the right-click menu for the Controllers folder, Add is selected, and from its menu, Controller is selected.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image34.png "Solution Explorer")

2.  Select **MVC 5 Controller -- Empty, and click Add.** Replace **Default** with **Account** for the controller name.![On the left of the Add Scaffold window, Installed / Controller is selected. In the center of the window, MVC 5 Controller - Empty is selected.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image35.png "Add Scaffold window")

3.  Add the following using statement to the top of the controller:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.Owin.Security;
    ```

4.  Replace the default controller method Index

    ![The Default controller method Index is circled.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image36.png "Default controller method Index")

    With the following code:

    ```csharp
    // Controllers\AccountController.cs

    public void SignIn()
    {
        if (!Request.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            // To execute a policy, you simply need to trigger an OWIN challenge.
            // You can indicate which policy to use by specifying the policy id as the AuthenticationType
            HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.Challenge(
                new AuthenticationProperties () { RedirectUri = "/" }, Startup.SignInPolicyId);
        }
    }

    public void SignUp()
    {
        if (!Request.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.Challenge(
                new AuthenticationProperties() { RedirectUri = "/" }, Startup.SignUpPolicyId);
        }
    }


    public void Profile()
    {
        if (Request.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.Challenge(
                new AuthenticationProperties() { RedirectUri = "/" }, Startup.ProfilePolicyId);
        }
    }

    ```

5.  You can also use OWIN to sign out the user from the app. Add the following method to the account controller (**Controllers\\AccountController.cs**):

    ```csharp
    C\# Copy
    ```

    ```csharp
    // Controllers\AccountController.cs
    public void SignOut()
    {
        // To sign out the user, you should issue an OpenIDConnect sign out request
        if (Request.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            IEnumerable<AuthenticationDescription> authTypes = HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.GetAuthenticationTypes();

            HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.SignOut(authTypes.Select(t => t.AuthenticationType).ToArray());

            Request.GetOwinContext().Authentication.GetAuthenticationTypes();
        }
    }
    ```

### Task 8: Display user information

When you authenticate users by using OpenID Connect, Azure AD returns an ID token to the app that contains **claims**. These are assertions about the user. You can use claims to personalize your app. You can access user claims in your controllers via the ClaimsPrincipal.Current security principal object.

1.  Open the **Controllers\\HomeController.cs file** and add the following using statements at the end of the other using statements.

    ```csharp
    using System.Linq;

    using System.Security.Claims;
    ```

2.  Open the **Controllers\\HomeController.cs** file and add the following method:

    ```csharp
    [Authorize]

    public ActionResult Claims()
    {
        Claim displayName = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst(ClaimsPrincipal.Current.Identities.First().NameClaimType);
        ViewBag.DisplayName = displayName != null ? displayName.Value : string.Empty;
        return View();
    }
    ```

3.  You can access any claim that your application receives in the same way. A list of all the claims the app receives is available for you on the **Claims** page. Right click on **Views -\> Home,** click **Add -\> MVC 5 View Page (Razor)** and name it **Claims.** 

    ![In Solution Explorer, on the right-click menu for Views\\Home, Add is selected, and from its menu, MVC 5 View Page (Razor) is selected.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image37.png "Solution Explorer")

4.  Open the **Claims.cshtml** file and replace the code with the following:

    ```csharp
    @using System.Security.Claims
    @{
        ViewBag.Title = "Claims";
    }
    <h2>@ViewBag.Title</h2>

    <h4>Claims Present in the Claims Identity: @ViewBag.DisplayName</h4>

    <table class="table-hover claim-table">
        <tr>
            <th class="claim-type claim-data claim-head">Claim Type</th>
            <th class="claim-data claim-head">Claim Value</th>
        </tr>

        @foreach (Claim claim in ClaimsPrincipal.Current.Claims)
        {
            <tr>
                <td class="claim-type claim-data">@claim.Type</td>
                <td class="claim-data">@claim.Value</td>
            </tr>
        }
    </table>
    ```

5.  Right click on the **Views -\> Shared** folder, click **Add**, and add a new **MVC 5 Partial Page (Razor)**. Specify **\_LoginPartial** for the name.

    ![In Solution Explorer, on the right-click menu for Views\\Shared, Add is selected, and from its menu, MVC 5 Partial Page (Razor) is selected.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image38.png "Solution Explorer")

6.  Add the following code to the razor partial view to provide a sign-in and sign-out link as well as a link to edit the user's profile.

    ```csharp
    @if (Request.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        <text>
            <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
                <li>
                    <a id="profile-link">@User.Identity.Name</a>
                    <div id="profile-options" class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
                        <ul class="profile-links">
                            <li class="profile-link">
                                @Html.ActionLink("Edit Profile", "Profile", "Account")
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    @Html.ActionLink("Sign out", "SignOut", "Account")
                </li>
            </ul>
        </text>
    }
    else
    {
        <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
            <li>@Html.ActionLink("Sign up", "SignUp", "Account", routeValues: null, htmlAttributes: new { id = "signUpLink" })</li>
            <li>@Html.ActionLink("Sign in", "SignIn", "Account", routeValues: null, htmlAttributes: new { id = "loginLink" })</li>
        </ul>
    }

    ```

7.  Open Views\\Shared\\\_Layout.cshtml in Visual Studio. Locate the header-tap div. and add the two lines highlighted.

    ```xml
    <div class="header-top">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="header-top-left">
                <a href="#"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a>
                <a href="#"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a>
                <a href="#"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a>
                <a href="#"><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a>
                </div>
                <div class="header-top-right">
                    <a href="#" class="top-wrap"><span class="icon-phone">Call today: </span> (555) 555-8000</a>
                    @Html.ActionLink("Claims", "Claims", "Home")                                        
                </div>                   
                @Html.Partial("_LoginPartial")
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    ```

### Task 9: Run the sample app

1.  Right click on the **Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.Web** project, and click **Publish**. Follow the steps to deploy the updated application to the Microsoft Azure Web App.

Launch a browser outside of Visual Studio for testing if the page loads in Visual Studio.

2.  Test out Sign up. Next, test Sign out.

3.  When you click on Claims and are not signed in, it will bring you to the sign-in page and then display the claim information. Sign in, and test Edit Profile.

    ![On the Contoso website, the following links are circled: Claims, Sign up, and Sign in.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image39.png "Contoso website")

    Claims information page![On the Contoso website, the following links are circled: Russell, Sign out, and Edit Profile.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image40.png "Contoso website, Claims information page")

## Exercise 4: Enabling Telemetry with Application Insights

To validate the scalability of the application and to configure telemetry, you have been asked to configure Microsoft Azure Application Insights and perform a web load test using Azure DevOps.

### Task 1: Configure the application for telemetry

##### Tasks to complete

-   Configure a method to capture telemetry information for the application for the server and client side.

-   Complete the implementation of the TrackException and TrackEvent method in Helpers\\TelemetryHelper.cs.

-   Republish the web application with telemetry enabled.

#### Exit criteria

-   Verify that when you browse to the website, the telemetry data appears.

### Task 2: Creating the web performance test and load test

##### Tasks to complete

-   Submit several test orders to verify that telemetry is capturing custom events

-   Simulate a load test of at least 250 users browsing the home page over a 5-minute time frame

-   Use the monitoring capabilities of your telemetry solution to identify failures from the test (if any)

-   Use the monitoring capabilities of your telemetry solution to identify performance issues from the test

#### Exit criteria

-   You should be able to view the average response time for the simulated load test

-   The telemetry solution should show custom events captured by the application such as new orders

-   The telemetry solution should show performance numbers such as the number of sessions and average response time

## Exercise 5: Automating backend processes

Contoso wants to automate the process of generating receipts in PDF format and alerting users when their orders have been processed.

### Task 1: Create an Azure Function to Generate PDF Receipts

##### Tasks to Complete 

-   Create an Azure Function in the contososports resource group using the assets in C:\\Hackathon\\Contoso Sports League\\Contoso.CreatePDFReport

-   Execute the function using the example data in Sample.dat to validate it generates a PDF in your storage account

-   Use Storage Explorer or Visual Studio to view the generated PDF file

#### Exit criteria

-   You should have a function that accepts the format specified in Sample.dat and generates a PDF file in the storage account for the Contoso Sports solution.

### Task 2: Create an Azure Logic App to Process Orders

##### Tasks to Complete

-   Create an Azure Logic App that listens for new orders on the receiptgenerator storage queue

-   When a new message is received pass it to the Azure Function using the same syntax as the sample.dat file

    -   Hint: the following can be used to base64 encode the data
    ```
    "Order": "@{base64(triggerBody()?['MessageText'])}"
    ```

-   After the receipt is generated the order row should be updated HasBeenShipped value and the link to the receipt so the admin app can display it correctly.

    -   Hint the following values will need to be updated in SQL:
    ```
    "OrderDate": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['OrderDate']}",
    "FirstName": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['FirstName']}",
    "LastName": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['LastName']}",
    "Address": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['Address']}",
    "City": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['City']}",
    "State": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['State']}",
    "PostalCode": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['PostalCode']}",
    "Country": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['Country']}",
    "Phone": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['Phone']}",

## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 10 Minutes

### Task 1: Delete resources

1.  Since the HOL is now complete, go ahead and delete all of the Resource Groups that were created for this HOL. You will no longer need those resources and it will be beneficial to clean up your Azure Subscription.

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the hands-on lab.
